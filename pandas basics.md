## Pandas Basics
### What is Pandas?

**Pandas** is a powerful, open-source Python library that provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.
It's a must-have library for data scientists and analysts as it makes working with data easier and more efficient.

### Data Structure in Pandas

### Series

A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding a variety of data types, including integers, floats, strings, and booleans. It is similar to a NumPy array but with the addition of labels for the data points. Series are commonly used to represent time series data or cross-sectional data.

### DataFrames

A DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled tabular data structure with rows and columns. It is similar to a spreadsheet or database table. DataFrames can store various data types in its columns, and each row represents a distinct observation. DataFrames are well-suited for storing and analyzing complex datasets with multiple variables and observations.

| Feature         | Series                                              | DataFrames                                                      |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dimensionality  | One-dimensional                                     | Two-dimensional                                                 |
| Data Type       | Single data type per Series                         | Can store multiple data types in columns                        |
| Structure       | Labeled array                                       | Labeled tabular data                                            |
| Usage           | Representing time series data or cross-sectional data | Storing and analyzing complex datasets with multiple variables and observations |
